In this folder I add draft posts in markdown format (md extension) that I'm
still writing. Once a draft posts is finalized I move it to the _posts
folder with an appropriate name.

Notice that posts here will only be read by Jekyll if the '--watch' option
is passed to the command 'jekyll serve'. This is useful while writing the
posts so that I can preview it before committing to Github.



Any HTML file here was not created directly and will be ignored by Git.  I
can also create posts in org-mode format, but in that case I'll create them
in the org/drafts folder first. Any post in 'org-mode' format created in
the org/drafts folder will be exported (by properly configured org-mode) to
this folder in HTML format.
