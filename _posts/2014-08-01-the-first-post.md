title: The first post
---

This is the first post I actually write in Jekyll. I decided to start
writing a blog mainly to have a place where I can put knowledge and random
thoughts. I imagine many blogs start like this.

This first post is intended to get the Jekyll structure up and learn how it
integrates with github pages.
