title: Github Jekyll General Informations

Github runs Jekyll in *safe* mode, which means we can't use third party
Jekyll plugins. The only way is if we run Jekyll locally to process
everything and commit that instead of letting Github do that.

If you want to have a similar Jekyll environment to Github's, see the URL below 
https://pages.github.com/versions/
