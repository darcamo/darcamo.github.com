Alguns lugares usam \(\phi\) para denotar o point processes, outros usam
\(\xi\).



* What is a Point process

Consider the \(d\) dimensional Euclidean space \(\bbR^d\). A spacial point
process (p.p.) \(\Phi\) is a random, finite or countably-infinity
collection of points in the space \(\bbR^d\), without accumulation points.


One can consider any given realization \(\phi\) of a point process as a
discrete subset \(\phi = \{x_i\} \subset \bbR^d\) of the space. It is often
more convenient to think of \(\phi\) as a /counting measure/ or a /point
measure/ \(\phi = \sum_{i}\delta_{x_i}\), where \(\delta_{x}\) is the
/Dirac measure/ at \(x\)[fn:1].


More specifically, for a set \(\bbA \subset \bbR^d\) the value of
\(\phi(\bbA)\) will be the number of "points" of \(\phi\) in \(\bbA\).



In the study of processes subject to randomness, one is interested in doing
statistical inference over such process.  One classical approach is
likelihood estimation of parameters of interest. Note that inference for
stochastic processes, in particular, for point processes differs clearly
from the approach of classical inference based on a sample of size n,
i.e. n i.i.d. random variables. In the case of point processes we do not
have a sequence of realizations of the point process on which to base the
inference, but only a unique realization of the process.

* Poisson Point Process

  One of the simplest processes and most interesting is the so called
  Poisson Process. The Poisson processes is used usually as a model for
  counting problems. Suppose that we are counting the number of events
  falling into a certain region of the space. Assume that: the number of
  events in distinct regions of the space are independent and the number of
  points in a certain region of the space has a Poisson distribution, then
  the process obtained is called a Poisson process.


  - Definition :: Let v(.) be a Borel measure on K, then a point process X on K is a Poisson point process with intensity v(.) if :
  N(A) is Poisson distributed with mean v(A) for every bouned Borel set A
  included in K, For any k disjoint bounded Borel set A1,...,Ak the random
  variables N(A1),...,N(Ak) are independent.

  The intensity measure of the Poisson point process is proportional to the
  Lebesgue measure on K:
      
      \[v(.) = \beta \lambda_K(.)\]

  The mean number of points falling in K is then:
  
      \[\E[N(K)] = \beta \lambda_K(K)\]

  To generate points in K with the distribution of this point process a two
  step procedure can be used :
  - First simulate N according to a Poisson law with mean given by the
    latter equation (it gives N=n),
  - Then sample each of the n point according to a uniform law on K.

    
  This enhance the fundamental properties of the uniform Poisson point
  process:
  - Points are uniformly distibuted, knowing the number of points,
  - Points are independent.


*** Properties
    A homogeneous Poisson process X with constant intensity Î»0 (number of
    points per unit area) has two properties :
    1. the density of points is constant in the area under investigation
    2. the location of any point in the pattern is independent of the
       location of any of the other points in the pattern, i.e. there is no
       interaction between the points
       
    Let \(\mu\) be the Lebesgue measure on the Borel sets in S. Then the
    Poisson process on S with intensity \(\lambda_0\) has the properties :
    1. For any Borel set \(B \in S\) the cardinality of \(B\), \(X(B)\),
       follows a Poisson distribution with mean \(\lambda_0 \cdot \mu(B)\).
    2. For any disjoint Borel sets \(B_1, \ldots, B_{n0} \subseteq S\) with
       an arbitrary \(n_0 \geq 2\), \(X(B1), \ldots, X(B_{n0})\) are
       independent.


* Transformations

  - superposition :: overlap points of one process onto those of another
                     point process
  - thinning :: delete certain points
  - rescaling :: stretching the axis

* Other definitions
  - *simple*: point process is known as simple if all points are almost
    surely distinct. As an example, consider a temporal point processes, in
    that case it will be called a /simple point process/ if all points
    occur at distinct

  - *expectation measure*: 
  - *Laplace functional*: 
  - *moment measure*:
  - *Stationarity*: For a stationary point process, the mean measure 
    \(E\{\phi (\cdot)\} = \lambda \|\cdot\|\) for some constant \(\lambda \geq 0\)
    and where \(\|\cdot\|\) stands for the *Lebesgue* measure[fn:2]. This
    \(\lambda\) is called the *intensity* of the point process. A
    stationary point process on \(\bbR^d\) has almost surely either 0 or an
    infinite number of points in total.
  - Compact set: a set if /compact/ if it is /closed/ and /bounded/.
  - Accumulation point: limit point of an interval
  - Borel set: a Borel set is any set in a topological space that can be
    formed from open sets (or, equivalently, from closed sets) through the
    operations of countable union, countable intersection, and relative
    complement.
  - marked point process: The points of a point process are typically
    indistinguishable other than by their times and/or locations. When
    there is other important information to be stored along with each
    point, such as a list of times of wildfire origin times along with
    their corresponding burn areas, or the earthquake times and magnitudes
    shown in Figure 1, the result may be viewed as a /marked/ point
    process.
  - martingale: In probability theory, a martingale is a model of a fair
    game where knowledge of past events never helps predict the mean of the
    future winnings. In particular, a martingale is a sequence of random
    variables (i.e., a stochastic process) for which, at a particular time
    in the realized sequence, the expectation of the next value in the
    sequence is equal to the present observed value even given knowledge of
    all prior observed values at a current time.

    A basic definition of a discrete-time martingale is a discrete-time
    stochastic process (i.e., a sequence of random variables) \(X_1, X_2,
    X_3, \ldots\) that satisfies for any time \(n\),
    \[\mathbf{E} ( \vert X_n \vert )< \infty\]
    \[\mathbf{E} (X_{n+1}\mid X_1,\ldots,X_n)=X_n.\]

  - /self-exciting/ and /self-correcting/ point processes: A point process
    N may be called self-exciting if \(\operatorname{cov}\{N(s,t), N(t,u)\}
    > 0\) for \(s < t < u\). N is self-correcting if instead this
    covariance is negative. Thus the occurrence of points in a
    self-exciting point process causes other points to be more likely to
    occur, whereas in a self-correcting process, the points have an
    inhibitory effect. By definition, a Poisson process is neither
    self-exciting nor self-correcting.

    
* Footnotes

[fn:1] If \(\delta_{x}\) is the Diract measure at \(x\) then \(\delta_{x}(\bbA) = 1\) if \(x \in \bbA\) and \(\delta_{x}(\bbA) = 0\) if \(x \notin \bbA\).

[fn:2] The Lebesgue measure is the standard way of assigning a measure to subsets of n-dimensional Euclidean space. For \(n = 1, 2\), or \(3\), it coincides with the standard measure of length, area, or volume. In general, it is also called \(n\)-dimensional volume, n-volume, or simply volume.
