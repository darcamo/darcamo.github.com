This file is intended to test creating posts with org-mode.  I'll add stuff
here to test different functionalities, such as including images, adding
links, exporting babel results, etc..

You need to configure =org-publish-project-alist= correctly and the export
you project. This should copy the exported HTML file to the correct folder
that jekyll reads.
